# narnoo-php-sdk

The narnoo-php-sdk is a library to interact with Narnoo's RESTFUL API. It performs all the heavy coding work so PHP developers can quickly make calls to our API.

> Detailed information about using this API will be added to this page and the repo Wiki.

# Get started with the PHP SDK

## Installation

Install our [library with composer](https://packagist.org/packages/narnoo/php-sdk):
```
composer require narnoo/php-sdk
```

## Authentication

You can find your business API keys from within your business's Narnoo.com account. Only businesses with an approved plan have access to their API keys.

Once you have your API keys then you can authenticate your API calls and return your bearer token.

```php

<?php
include "vendor/autoload.php";
use Narnoo\Authenticate\Authenticate;

$authen 	= new Authenticate();
$key 		= 'xxxxxxxxxxxx';
$secret 	= 'xxxxxxxxxxxx';
$token 		= $authen->getToken($key,$secret);

//For testing purposes we print out the response. However, you would save this taken to your database for future calls.
echo "<pre>";
print_r($token);
echo "</pre>";
?>

```
